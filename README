Cache simulator by Jonathan Lafiandra
Trace reader by CS4290 TAs

To compile with g++ do:
    make

To compile with cc do:
    make C=1

In any case, to clean do:
    make clean


To run after making, type:
./cachesim < traces/file.trace

with file being either:
	astar
	bzip2
	mcf
	perlbench

Extra Parameters:
Example: ./cachesim -c 13 -b 6 -s 2 < traces/astar.trace
-c ~ Cache Size(-c 12 = 2^12 = 4096 Bytes in the cache)
-b ~ Block size(-b 2 = 2^2 = 4 bytes in a block)
-s ~ Set size(-s 0 = Directly Mapped Cache, S=C-B = Fully Associative)

-t ~ 0 = No Prefetcher
     1 = Markov Prefetcher
     2 = n+1 Prefetcher(Nextline Prefetcher)
     3 = Hybrid of Markov and n+1

Prefetch buffer holds 32 Cache Blocks.

-p ~Denotes # of rows in Markov Prefetcher
